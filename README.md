- I coded the pages by Pelumi in three days. I learnt new things doing the task and I'm grateful to ECX for this opportunity. I believe in the coming tasks, we are going to be able to perform better and deliver efficient solution to tasks as a team after getting to know each other. 

3. Samuel Nwoko BE
- conveted html and css pages to ejs and setup server to run project.. created database and little logic to verify scratch cards and redirect to dashboard

### How to test
Due to unforseen circumstances, very little was done on the project, only 3 pages are working, but the scratch card verification and redirection to dashboard works fine.

### Valid scratch card details for testing
